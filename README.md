### Lab 1

Write Up: This lab involved setting up the artemis and experimenting with the Arduino IDE. The first example experimented with in this lab involved using `digitalWrite()` to blink the LED onboard by driving it high for half a second then driving it low for yet another half a second. The demonstration of this is included in link [1]. The second taks involved experimenting with the serial monitor. The taks involved (with code already provided) having the serial monitor output what it reads in as input. In such a fashion, it essentially _echoes_ the input.
