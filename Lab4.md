## LAB 4

### Lab 4

**Write Up:** 

This lab involved relatively limited software steps. The amount of experiments I could personally run was unfortunately limited. I could not effectively utilize the  the sensors to attain various measurements since the week designated for lab 4 was one for which I had to head back to my home state for citizenship interviews and paperwork. The limitations included the inability to properly use the artemis battery (since can't use the JTAG connector), placing the sensors in various positions on the RC car, and communicating with the Artemis board. 

Properties of A that were measured:

Dimensions: 17cm vs 14.5cm
Weight: 
Time to charge depletion at full operation: 8 minutes

Experiment from B that was utilized:
Manual control - distance from the wall at full speed approach:

Preliminary statistics:
Distance starting to wall: 3.55 m (room limitations)
Battery charge at run: presumably 100%
Wall coordinate - 0 cm
Deceleration start - 120 cm from wall
Minimum distance achieved from wall - 14.5 cm
